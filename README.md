# AI-Powered Homework Tracker

## Overview
This project is designed for the **RIT-Dubai Engineering Competition**. The challenge involves creating an innovative AI-driven system that simplifies homework management by tracking assignments, organizing tasks, and boosting productivity. The system provides smart features like deadline reminders, workload predictions, and personalized suggestions, aiming to help students manage their academic responsibilities more efficiently.

## AI-Powered System Features
The AI-powered system aims to streamline homework management through features such as:
- **Task Tracking**: Automatically track and manage homework assignments.
- **Task Organization**: Organize tasks based on deadlines, difficulty, and user preferences.
- **Valuable Insights**: Predict task duration, prioritize assignments, and suggest recurring tasks using AI.
- **Deadline Reminders**: Notify users about upcoming deadlines.
- **Workload Predictions**: Analyze user data to predict workload and help optimize study schedules.

## Competition Rules

### Eligibility
- Open to **high school students** (one team per school, up to 3 members).
- All submissions must be **original work** created specifically for the competition.
- Third-party libraries and open-source tools are allowed with proper attribution.

### Project Scope
- Design an **AI-based system** to track assignments, organize tasks, and provide insights.
- The solution can be a **mobile app**, **web app**, or **desktop application**.
- The system must include AI/ML features such as task prioritization, time estimation, or personalized task suggestions based on user habits.

### Submission Guidelines
- A **functioning prototype** or demo of the AI-based homework tracker.
- A **project report** (max 5 pages) detailing the design, functionality, and technical approach.
- A **presentation and demo** (max 5 minutes) explaining the system’s features and AI components.
- Submissions must be uploaded to the competition drive (link to be shared later).

## Technical Specifications

### Platform
- The system must run on **Windows**, **macOS**, or **Android/iOS** platforms.
- **Web-based applications** should support major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).

### Programming Languages
- Any programming languages and frameworks suitable for the project are allowed (e.g., Python, JavaScript, Swift, Java).
- AI libraries such as **TensorFlow**, **PyTorch**, or **Scikit-learn** are permitted.

### AI Integration
The system must include AI-based functionality such as:
- **Task Prediction**: Learn from user input to predict future tasks or suggest recurring assignments.
- **Task Prioritization**: Intelligently rank tasks based on deadlines, difficulty, and user preferences.
- **Time Estimation**: Estimate how long a task will take based on past data.

### Data Requirements
- Teams can use publicly available datasets or generate their own synthetic data.
- **Data privacy** must be respected, and no personally identifiable information (PII) should be used without consent.

## User Interface Requirements
The system must provide a **user-friendly interface** where students can:
- Input homework assignments manually or automatically (e.g., via text recognition).
- View a list of upcoming tasks with deadlines.
- Receive **notifications** or reminders about upcoming assignments.

## Testing Procedure

### Initial Review
- Judges will review the project submission materials (report, code, and video) to ensure the basic requirements are met.

### Functionality Testing
- The AI system will be tested for how well it organizes and tracks assignments.

### Performance Testing
- Judges will assess how quickly the AI system processes data and responds to inputs.
- Stability and error-handling will also be evaluated.

### AI Performance Testing
- The AI system will be tested under various scenarios to evaluate how well it adapts to different task loads and priorities.
- Systems should demonstrate **learning over time**, making better suggestions for task prioritization and time estimates.
